The patient had no chest pain history until 1992 when she presented with chest pain and had a markedly positive exercise tolerance test. She had recurrent typical chest pain and fatigue at 3 minutes and 45 seconds on standard Bruce protocol with a maximal heart rate of 129 , maximal blood pressure 120/80 , and 1 mm ST depressions. Patient was treated medically but returned with chest pain at rest. Cardiac catheterization revealed single vessel coronary artery disease ( 80% mid right coronary artery ) for which a PTCA was attempted but was complicated by dissection so the patient had an emergent saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and LIMA to the left anterior descending. Patient was on an intraaortic balloon pump when she developed a cold right lower extremity and had an emergent right femorofemoral bypass. The patient did well until 2/11 ( with rare episodes approximately four per year of rest angina which began approximately six months post-coronary artery bypass graft and were all relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin ) when she developed worsening right lower extremity claudication requiring angioplasty.

404,404.0,DILATION CARDIOMYOPATHY WITH HEART FAILURE ,,"This 49 year old lady was admitted with increasing shortness of breath and increasing abdominal girth in a setting of known dilated cardiomyopathy on the cardiac transplant list. Her history extends back to 1995 when she was fist admitted with shortness of breath and an ejection fraction of 15% with 3+ mitral regurgitation in a setting of excessive alcohol use. Her cardioangiogram at that time showed right dominant system without coronary artery disease and her exercise stress test revealed a VO2 of 12.6. The presumptive diagnosis at that time was alcoholic relation dilatation cardiomyopathy. In 11/18 she represented with an ejection fraction of 20% with moderate mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement and she was treated with digoxin , diuretics and ace inhibitors. It subsequently was revealed that there was a strong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and , in fact , subsequently two of her sons , ages 13 years old , were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and her diagnosis was therefore altered from alcoholic to familial cardiomyopathy. In 10/22 she was admitted with acute pancreatitis and developed acute renal failure requiring intubation. Her stay was complicated by Staphylococcal bacteremia. She recovered but presented again in 11/13 with a history of progressive shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , PND and abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting and anorexia. She required dobutamine and IV Lasix and had an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. In 11/10 she presented with syncope in the presence of a potassium of 2.4 and was diagnosed with Torsades de Pointes in the setting of hypokalemia and acute TC of 0.68. In 3/14 she represented with an ejection fraction of 20% with a left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis and required IV diuresis. In 3/26 she had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for multiple gallstones. In 1/20 she was admitted for cardiac transplant evaluation and found to a VO2 of 9.2 , a DLCL of 62% predicted and she was negative for PPD. She was admitted in 9/18 for IV diuresis and potassium repletion , and again in 5/12 with abdominal distention and orthopnea. Pancreatitis was ruled out at that stage and she was again treated with IV Lasix. She represented on her last admission on 23 of September with congestive heart failure requiring intravenous Lasix , Aldactone , Diuril and Zaroxolyn , ultimately requiring dobutamine for inotropic support for a short period of time. On this admission she gives a history of two days of increased shortness of breath with orthopnea and mild PND with diminished exercise tolerance. She has been reluctant to combine torsemide and her regular intravenous Lasix at home which was given to her by the VNA and feeling increasingly shortness of breath she was taken to the emergency department at Ield Hospital There she was treated with 200 mg of IV Lasix and had a 1.2 liter diuresis , felt better , and was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and management.

The patient had also previously been begun on amiodarone for chemical cardioversion , however , he developed severe hyperthyroidism. The patient also has had several recent admissions for exacerbations of his congestive heart failure , most recently in February , 1998 when he was admitted for tailored therapy. At that time , an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of , approximately , 20 percent with atrial dimension of 5 centimeters , left ventricular diastolic dimension of 7.7 centimeters , moderate-severe mitral regurgitation , and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 40 , plus right atrial pressure. The patient was , at that time , diuresed to his dry weight , which is approximately 186 pounds. Unfortunately , he was again admitted in February of 1998 with volume overload and was diuresed. At that time , he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation , and was cardioverted on his previously implanted AICD. His most recent admission was on May to March , when he again was cardioverted by his AICD for atrial fibrillation and treated for volume overload. In October of 1999 , he had increasing firing of his AICD both for true ventricular tachycardia , as well as for atrial fibrillation , and anti-tachycardia pacing. He was seen in cardiomyopathy clinic on July , and was found to be in atrial fibrillation and volume overloaded. His diuretics were increased at that time , as his weight was 207 pounds , and he diuresed down to a weight of 199 pounds. It was felt that amiodarone would be the best drug for him in terms of management of his ventricular and atrial arrhythmias , and so the patient underwent an elective thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine.

","Patient is a 61 year old female with coronary artery disease ( status post PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft ) who presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker placement. Ms. Debrecht 's pertinent medical history was significant for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease. In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional chest discomfort. Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance test was performed in 1/4 which was standard Bruce protocol at six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST depression inferolaterally. Cardiac catheterization in 6/9 revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90% and mid right coronary artery 99% ( with left-to-right and right-to-right collaterals ). The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20% residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% then re-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). Echo in 6/9 revealed an ejection fraction of 50% , inferior hypokinesis consistent with prior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen. Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal descending artery ) was performed in 6/9 ( Dr. Nethery ). Since then , she had done well with no further chest pain. Starting approximately one month prior to admission , the patient began to experience episodes of near syncope. Episodes consisted of the sensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , and diaphoresis ( although she felt near-syncopal , she had never actually experienced true syncope ). During episodes , she frequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis. She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only when she was at rest ( but not asleep ). Holter monitor on September , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses. The patient's anti-hypertensive , metoprolol ( 25 mg b.i.d. ) was discontinued , however , repeat Holter on 10/9/96 revealed multiple pauses ( 114 pauses in a 24-hour period ) with the longest lasting 4.2 seconds.

She was discharged to home on 5/4/97 to Diand Leb Hospital Hospital And Hospital where she developed epigastric discomfort and recurrent atrial fibrillation and was transferred back to Landso Souwalt Medical Center . Her cardiac history dates back to October of 1995 when she was admitted to Kassi Rehabilitation Hospital for an asthma flare. At that time she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were negative. An exercise test at that time showed she was able to go eight minutes on a Bruce protocol with 2 mm ST depressions in leads 2 , 3 , and F. A MIBI showed a small reversible defect inferiorly and she was managed medically at that time. In February of 1996 she was again admitted to Lita Hospital with chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction. She was started on Prilosec for presumed gastroesophageal reflux disease. In September of 1996 an exercise Thallium test showed she went eight minutes on a Bruce protocol with a heart rate of 125 , blood pressure 170/80 , and no ECG changes. She stopped secondary to chest pain. From 3/30/97 through 3/5/97 she presented with chest pressure at rest which radiated to her shoulders and jaw. On presentation she was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation. An ECG at that time showed elevated T-waves in V1 and V2. She was treated with Lopressor with slowing of the rate and relief of her chest pain. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 473 with an MB fraction of 32. Her Lopressor was changed to Verapamil secondary to increased wheezing requiring nebulizers. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed an left anterior descending artery that had 70% proximal lesion with collaterals , left circumflex artery with long 80 to 90% stenosis , right coronary artery 30 to 40% stenosis , left ventricle with ejection fraction of 58% , and apical akinesis. She spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm. Following catheterization the patient agreed to a coronary artery bypass graft but the procedure was postponed until she received Epogen therapy since she is a Jehovah's Witness. She was discharged in sinus rhythm. She returned on 10/17/97 and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times two which was complicated by a perioperative myocardial infarction with inferior ST elevations and peak CK of 386 and MB fraction of 8.1. Atrial fibrillation was not controlled with Verapamil. The patient was loaded on Digoxin and had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation. She converted to normal sinus rhythm and was discharged to rehabilitation on 5/4/97 in normal sinus rhythm. Her postoperative course was notable for gastrointestinal distress with epigastric burning , reflux , nausea , vomiting , and constipation. On 5/4/97 at rehabilitation the patient noted worsening epigastric burning with a sour taste in her mouth. This was relieved with Maalox. She was awakened from sleep with epigastric burning radiating to the right back and palpitations. ECG showed rapid atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125 to 150 and she was treated with Verapamil 2.5 mg IV times two and converted to normal sinus rhythm. The patient was noted to have ST elevations of 1 mm in 1 , 3 , and F and she was transferred to Yacull Hospital for further evaluation.

Mr. Kozub history begins in 9/13 when he presented with shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the setting of medications ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension ) noncompliance. He was found by echo to have severe aortic insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricular hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequently underwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valve repair. Aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration. One month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacement with dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess with cultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated with amphotericin-B , vancomycin and gentamicin. At this time , he also required coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. This hospital course was additionally complicated by development of third degree heart block necessitating the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. After discharge , Mr. Buzo did generally well for the following years until 9/4 , when he again presented with increasing shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation. Cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At this time , his aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude's valve. Again , following discharge , Mr. Kock did generally well until 4/19 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At that time , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dilatation ( The systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) , along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , and an ejection fraction of 15-20%. Stress testing at this time showed a physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what was done at this time , but apparently his Lasix was increased from 40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. Regarding this admission , Mr. Bessemer reports that he has been feeling fine and is here in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve , or if that doesn't work as it hasn't the last three times , to give him a new heart all together. He reports no increasing dyspnea , fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. He sleeps on three pillows at night and has not recently been short of breath when lying flat. He is able to do chores around the house without getting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath after one flight of stairs. He doesn't complain of significant disability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heart condition. He notes that he has not been able to participate in the marching band over the last year , but that he can play sitting down.

In the past five years the patient has also become morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds. Since 1995 she has noted development of significant bilateral lower extremity swelling. In October of 1996 she was treated for diabetic stasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home IV antibiotics. Part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling was attributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which was thought to be compromising venous return. Her massive edema was treated unsuccessfully with Lasix. The patient was doing well until about a week prior to admission when she developed some diarrhea consisting of two to three bowel movements a day. Her stool was watery brown without any blood or mucus. She also reported some nausea and vomiting as well as chills. She believes that she had fevers , but these temperatures were not measured. One day after the onset of her diarrhea the patient noted the development of burning pain on her left anterior thigh just above her knee. This was associated with increased erythema and mildly increased swelling in that area. She reports that her diarrhea , there had been stool running down her left thigh the previous day. This area of erythema on her left leg subsequently spread to the lateral surface of the thigh and was associated with increasing pain. The pain was so severe that it prevented the patient from her daily activities and from walking. The patient presented to the Emergency Department on 4/8 for worsening of her lower extremity pain and decreased p.o. intake. On the day of admission the patient states that her diarrhea had resolved and that she has had no abdominal pain. She has had no chest pain or shortness of breath or any other localizing signs of infection except her left leg. On admission she was found to have a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and she was placed in the Short Stay Unit.

The patient has no history of hypertension or tobacco use. The patient's history actually began in 1988 when he had chest pain and ruled in for an anteroseptal myocardial infarction. In 9/16 , he presented to the emergency room with wide complex tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion at the Joadi Community Hospital .  During the admission in 1998 , the patient had a catheterization which revealed proximal LAD occlusion , an occluded proximal descending artery off his right coronary artery , normal hemodynamics , anteroseptal hypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , apical thrombus , and aneurysm with an EF of 50%. An EP study revealed 27 and 22 beat runs of nonsustained V-tach with left bundle branch block inducible after three ventricular extra stimuli during ventricular drive pacing at 400 msec. The ventricular tachycardia was initially suppressed with quinidine , but the patient subsequently developed nausea and vomiting , and the quinidine was switched to aconine. The patient did well on this regimen until 3/13 , when he developed dyspnea on exertion , no chest pain , PND , and orthopnea. In 1/16 , the patient had an exercise tolerance test , which she failed secondary to fatigue. During this ETT , his blood pressure actually fell from 125 to 85 systolic and his EKG revealed 1 mm ST depression in the limb leads. Therefore , on 8/5/93 , he was admitted to the Eredrens Recraw University Of Medical Center and underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed 100% LAD and RCA occlusion , 60% proximal ramus stenosis , and left ventriculogram revealed anterior hypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , and apical dyskinesis with an ejection fraction of 48%. The decision was then made during his 1/16 admission to proceed with surgical revascularization. During his admission , he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft with LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and proximal descending artery , with endarterectomy to the proximal descending artery. The patient also underwent an EP study , and it was found that his sustained ventricular was no longer inducible either at baseline or during isoproterenol infusion. Since 1993 , the patient has been doing well up until the day of admission on 3/1 . On the day of admission , the patient developed light-headedness and palpitations while using the toilet. The patient denied any chest pain , dyspnea , nausea or vomiting at the time. EMS was notified , and the patient was found to be in V-tach.

He was admitted for transplant work-up , right heart catheterization and optimization of his medical treatment. He initially developed symptoms approximately six years prior to admission with complaints of dyspnea and orthopnea. His chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegaly and ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy. In 1992 , a catheterization was performed with clean coronary arteries by report. In February of 1994 , he had a ""cerebrovascular accident"". He was on Coumadin at that time. His symptoms included right hand and face anesthesia and hemiplegia which lasted only a few seconds and were self resolved. A CT was negative by report. He was started on Coumadin subsequently. In February of 1994 , he had an echocardiogram which demonstrated a left ventricular end diastolic diameter of 6.2 cm and ejection fraction of 20%. There was no thrombus seen. There was 2+ mitral regurgitation. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities. He was doing fairly well at home with medical management without any admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier this year. He began to have worsening symptoms following a viral illness in October of 1997. At that time an echocardiogram in October of 1997 demonstrated a probably left ventricular thrombus and ejection fraction of 12%. His Lasix dose was increased and his Atenolol dose was decreased. He improved and in October of 1997 , he was able to participate in activities such as sledding and skating with only occasional chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion. In October of 1997 , an exercise tolerance test was performed which he went 11 minutes. Maximum heart rate was 148. His rate pressure product was 18 , 000 and the peak oxygen consumption was 20.4. At the time nitrates were added to his regimen. His Atenolol was increased. However , nitrates were discontinued because of headache and insomnia.

At that time a right heart catheterization revealed high filling pressures and he was treated with aggressive diuresis. Angiography revealed occluded SVGs and a patent LIMA. Dobutamine radionuclide study revealed inferior and inferolateral infarct. There was no evidence of revascularization. Evaluation for heart transplant found cirrhosis by liver spleen scan which ruled out the possibility of transplant. He reported light-headedness and dizziness and was seen by the Electrophysiology Service who performed an EP study which was negative for provokable VT and since he is not a transplant candidate it was felt that empiric ICD placement would not be in his best interest. His light-headedness and presyncope worsened. His captopril dose was reduced from 37.5 mg to 25 mg t.i.d. with marked improvement in his energy and less dizziness. Over the past weeks his dizziness and light-headedness recurred and worsened with episodes of presyncope and frank syncope. On the day of admission he was scheduled for a clinic appointment.

He was admitted to the ICU for careful monitoring and fluid volume management postoperatively. He has had multiple abdominal surgeries. The mesh was originally placed for ventral hernia repair in 2005. He had since developed draining sinus tracts for which cultures have grown out MRSA. He was admitted preoperatively for reversal of anticoagulation and semi-urgent removal of the mesh. In the operating room , he underwent an exploratory laparotomy , lysis of adhesions and removal of the abdominal mesh. He was closed and one Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place. During the procedure , he was intubated with etomidate , succinylcholine and kept sedated with Versed and fentanyl. He received intraoperative vancomycin and levofloxacin as well as 2200 mL of lactated Ringer's. In an attempt to reverse anticoagulation , one unit of FFP was begun but then aborted due to hypotension , which resolved with epinephrine injection , likely due to transfusion reaction.

About one week prior to the admission , she began to have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She continued to have cough and shortness of breath at this time. The evening prior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , which radiated to her arm x1 hour. This pain improved after taking two sublingual nitroglycerin tables. She presented to the emergency department the following day complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. In the emergency department , the patient's vital signs were noted to be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with O2 sat 98% on room air. She was complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. Her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to 77/48. At this time , she was bolused with IV fluids , approximately 1.5 to 2 liters. Following the fluid bolus , she developed wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. However , she became more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressure continued to fall. Dopamine was started for blood pressure support. When she continued to desaturate into the 80% range and she was subsequently intubated. An echocardiogram at the bedtime showed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. In addition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5. She had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonary edema. She was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and was transferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiac cath laboratory. In the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the LIMA to the LAD and SVG to OMB were noted to be patent. However , all the other grafts were occluded. No interventions were undertaken. She was also noted to have elevated right and left-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40. She was subsequently transferred to the CCU where she was also noted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very small amounts of urine. A pH at that time was 7.13. Her cardiac output , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. She was treated with sodium bicarb and Lasix IV drip. Overnight , she developed a brisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. An echocardiogram obtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejection fraction of 45%. The entire inferior wall was noted to be akinetic. The posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. Global right ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. She was also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation. Her CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , one drawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which she was started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillin for Coag-negative staph bacteremia. She was also diagnosed with a UTI and started on levofloxacin. She was eventually extubated on 11/18/05. She was discharged from the CCU on 10/30/05 , and was accepted on to the Cards Aworth Service.

In April 1995 , her postoperative course had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusion which required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as a thorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication and drainage of effusions. At this time , she had also been dyspneic on exertion along with shortness of breath at rest. On April , 1995 , she had an echo which showed an EF of 59% , a mildly dilated left ventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branch block , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitral calcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.

An echo was performed and showed decreased left ventricular function within an EF of about 40% , decreased down from an EF of 59% documented in April 1995. Her CKs were flat an troponin I level later documented 0.4 , which was negative.

The first was an admission to an outside hospital from 5/25/01 - 11/20/01. At that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and was diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial effusion. She had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drained from her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. She was discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure , secondary to cor pulmonale. The second admission was from 8/28/01 - 8/10/01 at the Aen Medical Center . At that time , she had increased lower extremity edema. She was diuresed during that admission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. An echocardiogram at that time revealed mild LVH , an ejection fraction of 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-large pericardial effusion with fibrinous strands. A catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , an RV pressure of 45/11 , PA pressures of 38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , LV pressure was 127/14. There was no constrictive pericardial disease or restrictive cardiomyopathy. She also had no malignant cells in her pleural effusion , which was exudated. ANCA , ANA , SPEP were negative. She also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass or hydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein.

At that time , there were no EKG changes. His CK and troponin levels were flat. No arrhythmias were noted during the brief hospitalization. He was discharged on a beta blocker , as well as a calcium channel blocker. In September 1996 , the patient underwent a repeat annual exercise stress test. This time , he was able to go only 4.4 minutes , stopped with fatigue , shortness of breath , and palpitations , noted to correlate with atrial premature beats. He also developed 4/10 chest pressure that was relieved with rest and nitroglycerin. His maximum heart rate was 127 , maximum blood pressure 120/60. EKGs during exercise revealed 2 mm ST depressions in leads II , III , AVF , and V4 , and 1 mm depressions in leads V3 , V5 , and V6. These EKG changes persisted into 30 minutes of recovery.

Briefly , he was admitted to Tawde Memorial Hospital on 7/16/04 , with varied symptoms including a nonproductive cough , bronchospasm , and shortness of breath. He also was hypoglycemic with a glucose of 34 , likely due to anorexia and continued used of regular amounts of insulin. He was found to have positive cardiac enzymes as well with a troponin peaking at approximately 4.3 , and was seen by Cardiology , Renal Services in consultation. Concurrently , he was treated with a course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone for presumed bronchitis. The initial plan recommended by Cardiology included an echocardiogram , which was read at that time , indicated decreased ejection fraction of only about 15% to 20%. This represented a change from prior. The next step intended was for a cardiac catheterization , but there was concern regarding his aortic stenosis which despite a gradient of only 14% on echocardiogram , was concerning , as this might represent an underestimation. He was transferred to Mid-li Ners Lini Medical Center for further evaluation of both the need for aortic valve replacement and this new reduced ejection fraction , felt to likely be ischemic cardiomyopathy , with a demand related non-ST-elevation MI.
