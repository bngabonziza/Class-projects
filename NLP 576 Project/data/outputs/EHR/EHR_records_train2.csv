The patient is admitted for cardiac catheterization. The patient states that he has been in good health all of his life , with history of some hypertension and sinus tachycardia. He is followed by Drs. Freeman Theron Meley . A routine exercise stress test had been reported as equivocal for coronary artery disease. Records of this test are currently unavailable. Since 1995 , the patient has done well without any anginal symptoms until February 1996 when he was admitted to the Mara Bleyval Medical Center for rule out myocardial infarction after experiencing recurrent palpitations and sudden feelings of hunger associated with chest pressure. At that time , there were no EKG changes. His CK and troponin levels were flat. No arrhythmias were noted during the brief hospitalization. He was discharged on a beta blocker , as well as a calcium channel blocker. In September 1996 , the patient underwent a repeat annual exercise stress test. This time , he was able to go only 4.4 minutes , stopped with fatigue , shortness of breath , and palpitations , noted to correlate with atrial premature beats. He also developed 4/10 chest pressure that was relieved with rest and nitroglycerin. His maximum heart rate was 127 , maximum blood pressure 120/60. EKGs during exercise revealed 2 mm ST depressions in leads II , III , AVF , and V4 , and 1 mm depressions in leads V3 , V5 , and V6. These EKG changes persisted into 30 minutes of recovery. In the four weeks following this positive ETT , the patient noted a drastic decrease in his exercise capacity and he developed onset of substernal chest pain with exertion. This discomfort was associated with shortness of breath , no clear radiation. There was never any nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , or palpitations associated with this chest pain. In the two weeks prior to admission , the patient developed similar substernal chest pain at rest on several occasions. All of these were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. On the evening prior to admission , the patient developed substernal chest pain during a music concert. This occurred at rest and lasted approximately 10 minutes , relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. The next morning , the patient notified his primary cardiologist about the increased frequency of his chest pain , and he was , therefore , admitted for cardiac catheterization.

She had ST depressions on EKG intraoperatively , and was admitted to the ICU there. She was treated for a myocardial infarction and developed postmyocardial angina with EKG changes which were unrelieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. For this reason , she was started on IV TNG and transferred to Mead Ry'sweeks Hospital And Medical Center for cardiac catheterization. She underwent cardiac catheterization on 1/10/97 and this revealed three vessel disease. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 3/4/97 with a LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA , and SVG to OM1. Her postoperative course was complicated by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , with which she was symptomatic. She was started on procainamide during the admission and was discharged home on 1/4/97 with a subtherapeutic proc/nepa level ( 3.0-4.5 ). She arrived home at 4:30 p.m. and felt well until approximately 7:00 p.m. , when she developed acute onset of 8 out of 10 chest pain across her entire chest radiating down the left arm and associated with light-headedness and visual changes. She reported this was similar to a prior anginal episode. She took three sublingual nitroglycerin at home and had no relief. EMTs were called and found the patient pale , diaphoretic , with blood pressure 90/palp , and a heart rate of 150. She was treated with more nitroglycerin and improved somewhat in terms of her pain. She was taken to Aen Er/in Hospital where EKG showed rapid atrial fibrillation with ST depressions globally. She was given IV fluids and 750 mg of procainamide , as well as 20 mg of IV Cardizem and nitroglycerin. Her pain resolved. Her systolic blood pressure came up to the 110 range and her atrial fibrillation rate decreased to the 80s. Subsequently , she converted into normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 60s and was transferred to the Hamren Ry County Medical Center for further treatment.

Attempted PTCA was complicated by substernal chest pain and a CK peaked to 1920. He required an intra-aortic balloon pump and emergent coronary artery bypass graft times three. The coronary artery bypass graft included SVG to LAG , SVG to OM1 , SVG to OM2. In 1990 , he underwent another exercise test with one millimeter ST depression thought secondary to fatigue.
