The patient had no chest pain history until 1992 when she presented with chest pain and had a markedly positive exercise tolerance test. She had recurrent typical chest pain and fatigue at 3 minutes and 45 seconds on standard Bruce protocol with a maximal heart rate of 129 , maximal blood pressure 120/80 , and 1 mm ST depressions. Patient was treated medically but returned with chest pain at rest. Cardiac catheterization revealed single vessel coronary artery disease ( 80% mid right coronary artery ) for which a PTCA was attempted but was complicated by dissection so the patient had an emergent saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and LIMA to the left anterior descending. Patient was on an intraaortic balloon pump when she developed a cold right lower extremity and had an emergent right femorofemoral bypass. The patient did well until 2/11 ( with rare episodes approximately four per year of rest angina which began approximately six months post-coronary artery bypass graft and were all relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin ) when she developed worsening right lower extremity claudication requiring angioplasty.

404,404.0,DILATION CARDIOMYOPATHY WITH HEART FAILURE ,,"This 49 year old lady was admitted with increasing shortness of breath and increasing abdominal girth in a setting of known dilated cardiomyopathy on the cardiac transplant list. Her history extends back to 1995 when she was fist admitted with shortness of breath and an ejection fraction of 15% with 3+ mitral regurgitation in a setting of excessive alcohol use. Her cardioangiogram at that time showed right dominant system without coronary artery disease and her exercise stress test revealed a VO2 of 12.6. The presumptive diagnosis at that time was alcoholic relation dilatation cardiomyopathy. In 11/18 she represented with an ejection fraction of 20% with moderate mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement and she was treated with digoxin , diuretics and ace inhibitors. It subsequently was revealed that there was a strong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and , in fact , subsequently two of her sons , ages 13 years old , were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and her diagnosis was therefore altered from alcoholic to familial cardiomyopathy. In 10/22 she was admitted with acute pancreatitis and developed acute renal failure requiring intubation. Her stay was complicated by Staphylococcal bacteremia. She recovered but presented again in 11/13 with a history of progressive shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , PND and abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting and anorexia. She required dobutamine and IV Lasix and had an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. In 11/10 she presented with syncope in the presence of a potassium of 2.4 and was diagnosed with Torsades de Pointes in the setting of hypokalemia and acute TC of 0.68. In 3/14 she represented with an ejection fraction of 20% with a left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis and required IV diuresis. In 3/26 she had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for multiple gallstones. In 1/20 she was admitted for cardiac transplant evaluation and found to a VO2 of 9.2 , a DLCL of 62% predicted and she was negative for PPD. She was admitted in 9/18 for IV diuresis and potassium repletion , and again in 5/12 with abdominal distention and orthopnea. Pancreatitis was ruled out at that stage and she was again treated with IV Lasix. She represented on her last admission on 23 of September with congestive heart failure requiring intravenous Lasix , Aldactone , Diuril and Zaroxolyn , ultimately requiring dobutamine for inotropic support for a short period of time. On this admission she gives a history of two days of increased shortness of breath with orthopnea and mild PND with diminished exercise tolerance. She has been reluctant to combine torsemide and her regular intravenous Lasix at home which was given to her by the VNA and feeling increasingly shortness of breath she was taken to the emergency department at Ield Hospital There she was treated with 200 mg of IV Lasix and had a 1.2 liter diuresis , felt better , and was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and management.

The patient had also previously been begun on amiodarone for chemical cardioversion , however , he developed severe hyperthyroidism. The patient also has had several recent admissions for exacerbations of his congestive heart failure , most recently in February , 1998 when he was admitted for tailored therapy. At that time , an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of , approximately , 20 percent with atrial dimension of 5 centimeters , left ventricular diastolic dimension of 7.7 centimeters , moderate-severe mitral regurgitation , and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 40 , plus right atrial pressure. The patient was , at that time , diuresed to his dry weight , which is approximately 186 pounds. Unfortunately , he was again admitted in February of 1998 with volume overload and was diuresed. At that time , he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation , and was cardioverted on his previously implanted AICD. His most recent admission was on May to March , when he again was cardioverted by his AICD for atrial fibrillation and treated for volume overload. In October of 1999 , he had increasing firing of his AICD both for true ventricular tachycardia , as well as for atrial fibrillation , and anti-tachycardia pacing. He was seen in cardiomyopathy clinic on July , and was found to be in atrial fibrillation and volume overloaded. His diuretics were increased at that time , as his weight was 207 pounds , and he diuresed down to a weight of 199 pounds. It was felt that amiodarone would be the best drug for him in terms of management of his ventricular and atrial arrhythmias , and so the patient underwent an elective thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine.

","Patient is a 61 year old female with coronary artery disease ( status post PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft ) who presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker placement. Ms. Debrecht 's pertinent medical history was significant for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease. In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional chest discomfort. Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance test was performed in 1/4 which was standard Bruce protocol at six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST depression inferolaterally. Cardiac catheterization in 6/9 revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90% and mid right coronary artery 99% ( with left-to-right and right-to-right collaterals ). The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20% residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% then re-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). Echo in 6/9 revealed an ejection fraction of 50% , inferior hypokinesis consistent with prior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen. Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal descending artery ) was performed in 6/9 ( Dr. Nethery ). Since then , she had done well with no further chest pain. Starting approximately one month prior to admission , the patient began to experience episodes of near syncope. Episodes consisted of the sensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , and diaphoresis ( although she felt near-syncopal , she had never actually experienced true syncope ). During episodes , she frequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis. She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only when she was at rest ( but not asleep ). Holter monitor on September , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses. The patient's anti-hypertensive , metoprolol ( 25 mg b.i.d. ) was discontinued , however , repeat Holter on 10/9/96 revealed multiple pauses ( 114 pauses in a 24-hour period ) with the longest lasting 4.2 seconds.

She was discharged to home on 5/4/97 to Diand Leb Hospital Hospital And Hospital where she developed epigastric discomfort and recurrent atrial fibrillation and was transferred back to Landso Souwalt Medical Center . Her cardiac history dates back to October of 1995 when she was admitted to Kassi Rehabilitation Hospital for an asthma flare. At that time she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were negative. An exercise test at that time showed she was able to go eight minutes on a Bruce protocol with 2 mm ST depressions in leads 2 , 3 , and F. A MIBI showed a small reversible defect inferiorly and she was managed medically at that time. In February of 1996 she was again admitted to Lita Hospital with chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction. She was started on Prilosec for presumed gastroesophageal reflux disease. In September of 1996 an exercise Thallium test showed she went eight minutes on a Bruce protocol with a heart rate of 125 , blood pressure 170/80 , and no ECG changes. She stopped secondary to chest pain. From 3/30/97 through 3/5/97 she presented with chest pressure at rest which radiated to her shoulders and jaw. On presentation she was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation. An ECG at that time showed elevated T-waves in V1 and V2. She was treated with Lopressor with slowing of the rate and relief of her chest pain. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 473 with an MB fraction of 32. Her Lopressor was changed to Verapamil secondary to increased wheezing requiring nebulizers. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed an left anterior descending artery that had 70% proximal lesion with collaterals , left circumflex artery with long 80 to 90% stenosis , right coronary artery 30 to 40% stenosis , left ventricle with ejection fraction of 58% , and apical akinesis. She spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm. Following catheterization the patient agreed to a coronary artery bypass graft but the procedure was postponed until she received Epogen therapy since she is a Jehovah's Witness. She was discharged in sinus rhythm. She returned on 10/17/97 and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times two which was complicated by a perioperative myocardial infarction with inferior ST elevations and peak CK of 386 and MB fraction of 8.1. Atrial fibrillation was not controlled with Verapamil. The patient was loaded on Digoxin and had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation. She converted to normal sinus rhythm and was discharged to rehabilitation on 5/4/97 in normal sinus rhythm. Her postoperative course was notable for gastrointestinal distress with epigastric burning , reflux , nausea , vomiting , and constipation. On 5/4/97 at rehabilitation the patient noted worsening epigastric burning with a sour taste in her mouth. This was relieved with Maalox. She was awakened from sleep with epigastric burning radiating to the right back and palpitations. ECG showed rapid atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125 to 150 and she was treated with Verapamil 2.5 mg IV times two and converted to normal sinus rhythm. The patient was noted to have ST elevations of 1 mm in 1 , 3 , and F and she was transferred to Yacull Hospital for further evaluation.
