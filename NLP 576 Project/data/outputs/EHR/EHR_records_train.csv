Mr. Kozub history begins in 9/13 when he presented with shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the setting of medications ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension ) noncompliance. He was found by echo to have severe aortic insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricular hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequently underwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valve repair. Aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration. One month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacement with dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess with cultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated with amphotericin-B , vancomycin and gentamicin. At this time , he also required coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. This hospital course was additionally complicated by development of third degree heart block necessitating the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. After discharge , Mr. Buzo did generally well for the following years until 9/4 , when he again presented with increasing shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation. Cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At this time , his aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude's valve. Again , following discharge , Mr. Kock did generally well until 4/19 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At that time , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dilatation ( The systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) , along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , and an ejection fraction of 15-20%. Stress testing at this time showed a physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what was done at this time , but apparently his Lasix was increased from 40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. Regarding this admission , Mr. Bessemer reports that he has been feeling fine and is here in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve , or if that doesn't work as it hasn't the last three times , to give him a new heart all together. He reports no increasing dyspnea , fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. He sleeps on three pillows at night and has not recently been short of breath when lying flat. He is able to do chores around the house without getting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath after one flight of stairs. He doesn't complain of significant disability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heart condition. He notes that he has not been able to participate in the marching band over the last year , but that he can play sitting down.

The patient has had a long history of diabetes since 1984 for which she has been treated with diet and glyburide with poorly controlled blood sugars until Metformin was added in October of 1996. In the past five years the patient has also become morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds. Since 1995 she has noted development of significant bilateral lower extremity swelling. In October of 1996 she was treated for diabetic stasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home IV antibiotics. Part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling was attributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which was thought to be compromising venous return. Her massive edema was treated unsuccessfully with Lasix. The patient was doing well until about a week prior to admission when she developed some diarrhea consisting of two to three bowel movements a day. Her stool was watery brown without any blood or mucus. She also reported some nausea and vomiting as well as chills. She believes that she had fevers , but these temperatures were not measured. One day after the onset of her diarrhea the patient noted the development of burning pain on her left anterior thigh just above her knee. This was associated with increased erythema and mildly increased swelling in that area. She reports that her diarrhea , there had been stool running down her left thigh the previous day. This area of erythema on her left leg subsequently spread to the lateral surface of the thigh and was associated with increasing pain. The pain was so severe that it prevented the patient from her daily activities and from walking. The patient presented to the Emergency Department on 4/8 for worsening of her lower extremity pain and decreased p.o. intake. On the day of admission the patient states that her diarrhea had resolved and that she has had no abdominal pain.

The patient has no history of hypertension or tobacco use. The patient's history actually began in 1988 when he had chest pain and ruled in for an anteroseptal myocardial infarction. In 9/16 , he presented to the emergency room with wide complex tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion at the Joadi Community Hospital .  During the admission in 1998 , the patient had a catheterization which revealed proximal LAD occlusion , an occluded proximal descending artery off his right coronary artery , normal hemodynamics , anteroseptal hypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , apical thrombus , and aneurysm with an EF of 50%. An EP study revealed 27 and 22 beat runs of nonsustained V-tach with left bundle branch block inducible after three ventricular extra stimuli during ventricular drive pacing at 400 msec. The ventricular tachycardia was initially suppressed with quinidine , but the patient subsequently developed nausea and vomiting , and the quinidine was switched to aconine. The patient did well on this regimen until 3/13 , when he developed dyspnea on exertion , no chest pain , PND , and orthopnea. In 1/16 , the patient had an exercise tolerance test , which she failed secondary to fatigue. During this ETT , his blood pressure actually fell from 125 to 85 systolic and his EKG revealed 1 mm ST depression in the limb leads. Therefore , on 8/5/93 , he was admitted to the Eredrens Recraw University Of Medical Center and underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed 100% LAD and RCA occlusion , 60% proximal ramus stenosis , and left ventriculogram revealed anterior hypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , and apical dyskinesis with an ejection fraction of 48%. The decision was then made during his 1/16 admission to proceed with surgical revascularization. During his admission , he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft with LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and proximal descending artery , with endarterectomy to the proximal descending artery. The patient also underwent an EP study , and it was found that his sustained ventricular was no longer inducible either at baseline or during isoproterenol infusion. Since 1993 , the patient has been doing well up until the day of admission on 3/1 . On the day of admission , the patient developed light-headedness and palpitations while using the toilet. The patient denied any chest pain , dyspnea , nausea or vomiting at the time. EMS was notified , and the patient was found to be in V-tach.

The patient underwent an echocardiogram post-CABG showing normal left ventricular function with no regional wall motion abnormalities , moderate effusion and mild left atrial enlargement 4.8 centimeters. The patient did well for 2 years post-CABG and underwent an exercise tolerance test in 15 of September , exercising for 10 minutes and 0 seconds , maximum blood pressure 170/100 , without chest pain or electrocardiogram changes , considered to be a negative test. Since then , the patient has only had sharp incisional pain not related to exertion , and he suffers no exertional angina and has no exercise limitation. Over the past several months , the patient has gradually developed increasing exertional chest pain , increasing in both intensity and frequency , to the point where it was occurring daily 1 week prior to admission.

Her cardiac history began in 20 of April , when she presented with new substernal chest pain. She ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction , was treated with medical therapy and did well , until 5 of October , when she had progressive exertional chest heaviness and shortness of breath. An exercise tolerance test was positive at that time , and echocardiogram showed good left ventricular function. She had a cardiac catheterization which showed a 90% left anterior descending , 75% first diagonal , 75% second diagonal. The cardiac catheterization was complicated by foot cellulitis , sepsis and deep vein thrombosis and she was in and out of the hospital for several months recovering. Given this , she was hesitant to undergo further procedures and was treated with medical therapy. The patient did fairly well with stable angina and shortness of breath , until 1 year prior to admission when she had slowly progressive increase in her chest heaviness and shortness of breath , limiting her activities. Her anginal pattern has not changed recently in a significant manner , but over the last several months her pain has been extremely limiting to her activities , and thus she presented for cardiac catheterization and a question of revascularization. The patient has stable 2-pillow orthopnea , she has claudication with a 10-minute walk relieved with rest. The patient denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Her chest pain is not associated with diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , radiation , or syncope. It is associated with upper chest heaviness , shortness of breath and warmth in the chest and neck.

He was admitted for transplant work-up , right heart catheterization and optimization of his medical treatment. He initially developed symptoms approximately six years prior to admission with complaints of dyspnea and orthopnea. His chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegaly and ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy. In 1992 , a catheterization was performed with clean coronary arteries by report. In February of 1994 , he had a ""cerebrovascular accident"". He was on Coumadin at that time. His symptoms included right hand and face anesthesia and hemiplegia which lasted only a few seconds and were self resolved. A CT was negative by report. He was started on Coumadin subsequently. In February of 1994 , he had an echocardiogram which demonstrated a left ventricular end diastolic diameter of 6.2 cm and ejection fraction of 20%. There was no thrombus seen. There was 2+ mitral regurgitation. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities. He was doing fairly well at home with medical management without any admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier this year. He began to have worsening symptoms following a viral illness in October of 1997. At that time an echocardiogram in October of 1997 demonstrated a probably left ventricular thrombus and ejection fraction of 12%. His Lasix dose was increased and his Atenolol dose was decreased. He improved and in October of 1997 , he was able to participate in activities such as sledding and skating with only occasional chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion. In October of 1997 , an exercise tolerance test was performed which he went 11 minutes. Maximum heart rate was 148. His rate pressure product was 18 , 000 and the peak oxygen consumption was 20.4. At the time nitrates were added to his regimen. His Atenolol was increased. However , nitrates were discontinued because of headache and insomnia. Now , over the prior one to two months , proceeding admission , he has had worsening symptoms with orthopnea , dyspnea on minimal exertion with less than one flight of stairs , decreased appetite.

About one week prior to the admission , she began to have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She continued to have cough and shortness of breath at this time. The evening prior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , which radiated to her arm x1 hour. This pain improved after taking two sublingual nitroglycerin tables. She presented to the emergency department the following day complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. In the emergency department , the patient's vital signs were noted to be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with O2 sat 98% on room air. She was complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. Her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to 77/48. At this time , she was bolused with IV fluids , approximately 1.5 to 2 liters. Following the fluid bolus , she developed wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. However , she became more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressure continued to fall. Dopamine was started for blood pressure support. When she continued to desaturate into the 80% range and she was subsequently intubated. An echocardiogram at the bedtime showed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. In addition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5. She had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonary edema. She was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and was transferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiac cath laboratory. In the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the LIMA to the LAD and SVG to OMB were noted to be patent. However , all the other grafts were occluded. No interventions were undertaken. She was also noted to have elevated right and left-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40. She was subsequently transferred to the CCU where she was also noted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very small amounts of urine. A pH at that time was 7.13. Her cardiac output , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. She was treated with sodium bicarb and Lasix IV drip. Overnight , she developed a brisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. An echocardiogram obtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejection fraction of 45%. The entire inferior wall was noted to be akinetic. The posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. Global right ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. She was also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation. Her CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , one drawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which she was started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillin for Coag-negative staph bacteremia.

She responded well to IV Lasix and IV nitroglycerin , saturating at 99% on 100% nonrebreather mask. Chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema. Her blood pressure was stabilized on IV nitroglycerin with resolution of her shortness of breath. She was ruled out for myocardial infarction. The patient was also recently admitted one month ago to Stonemep Medical Center for flash pulmonary edema without evidence of myocardial infarction. Echo on admission showed 30% ejection fraction with anteroapical and posterobasal hypokinesis. Cardiac catheterization in January 1997 showed a 90% proximal RCA lesion and diffuse distal LAD disease. During vigorous rehydration following that cardiac catheterization , she developed recurrent pulmonary edema requiring intubation from which she was weaned following diuresis. Because her pulmonary edema was believed to be ischemia related , she was transferred to the Ha Hospital for RCA angioplasty. On this admission , she denies any chest pain , shortness of breath , or dizziness. She has three pillow orthopnea , ankle edema. She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with the exception of her current presentation.

She was treated with increased Lasix and Digoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change in her symptoms. She was then admitted on 8/7 after she was found to have a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent ultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. Evaluation of the pleural fluid revealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytology remaining negative. The patient was treated with Ancef for approximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and then discharged on 6/20/94. Since that time the patient has had no improvement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which remains productive of white sputum with occasional ""specks of red"" and progression of her dyspnea on exertion.
